# Walmart-Data-Analytics
Walmart deals with millions of transactions daily. To make sense of this data, the business needs a 
structured way to store and retrieve it for analysis. The CEO wants to understand which products 
are most popular, which customer demographics spend the most, and how sales vary over time.
# Business Story: 
Imagine you're helping Walmart solve this problem. The CEO and department managers rely on you 
to create a system that allows them to quickly answer questions like: 
* What are the top-selling products in each category?

* How do purchasing patterns change based on time?

* Which types of promotions result in the highest sales?

# Identify Frequently Bought Together Items 
## Business Problem: 
Walmart managers noticed that customers often buy certain items together, but they donâ€™t have 
clear data on which combinations are the most frequent. They need this insight to optimize store 
layout and improve cross-selling strategies. 
What You Need to Do: 
Write a query to find products that customers frequently purchase together. The results should: 
* Highlight popular combinations within the same category, excluding items that are just 
variations of each other (e.g., two types of milk count as one). 
* Show the number of times these combinations were purchased together, sorted by the 
most frequent pairs.

# Most Common Product Pairs:
Dairy:
Whole Milk + Yogurt: A staple pairing for breakfast or snacks.
Whipped/Sour Cream + Whole Milk: Likely used together in recipes.
Butter + Whole Milk: Common for baking or cooking.
Vegetables:
Other Vegetables + Root Vegetables: Often used together in meals.
Beverages:
Bottled Water + Soda: Frequently purchased together for convenience.

Store Reorganization:
Place Complementary Products Together:
Move Yogurt closer to Whole Milk in the Dairy section.
Place Root Vegetables near Other Vegetables in the Produce aisle.
Display soda next to bottled water in the beverage section.


If customers frequently buy products from different categories together (e.g., Dairy and Vegetables), consider creating cross-category displays near checkout counters.
